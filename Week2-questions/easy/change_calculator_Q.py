# Change Calculator
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# You need to calculate how much change is due when you go shopping.
# You have a $20 note and buy the following:
#   2 cartons of milk @ $2.50
#   5 Mars bars @ $1.20 each
#   1 pkt indigestion tablets @ $3.50

# Write an expression to calculate the change you should be given
# from $20, after buying those groceries.  Output
# the value of the change in a message to screen
# (Don't worry about trailing 0's in the result)
