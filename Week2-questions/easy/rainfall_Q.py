# Maximum average rainfall
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following values have already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, denoting the rainfall in millimetres recorded
# for several towns over a 7 day period:

aurukun =  [15, 9, 11, 4, 10, 20, 95]
burdekin = [13, 9, 5, 0, 80, 150, 145]
cardwell = [115, 90, 100, 46, 130, 200, 195]
daintree = [140, 120, 110, 53, 100, 50, 175]
tully = [115, 90, 100, 54, 130, 200, 195]

# Write expressions to calculate the highest average rainfall
# and print the result in a message to screen
