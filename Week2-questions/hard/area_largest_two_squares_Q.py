# The combined area of the largest two squares
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following value has already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, representing a list of measurements each of
# which is the length of the side of a square in centimetres

sides = [5, 1, 9, 3, 4, 6]

# Write an expression, or expressions, to calculate the combined area
# of the largest two squares
# Print that value to the screen in an appropriate message
