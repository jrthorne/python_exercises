# Remove the smallest and largest items of a list
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following value has already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, a list of seven numbers:

unsorted_numbers =  [9, 5, 8, 2, 7, 4, 6]

# Write an expression to calculate the middle five numbers in the list
# in order of their magnitude, not their position.  Print the list
# of middle values to screen
#
# Hint: use a built-in fuction to sort the list of numbers
