# Binary interpreter
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following list of binary digits (bits) has already been
# entered into the Python interpreter, representing a binary number

binary_number = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

# Write an expression, or expressions, to calculate the decimal value of that
# binary number and output it to screen
#
# NB: in decimal (aka base 10), each digit represents (from right to left):
# Ones, Tens, Hundreds ... eg 193:
#    H | T | O
#    1 | 9 | 3
# or in other words:
# 10^2|10^1|10^0   ie 10 raised to a power
#   1 |  9 |  3
#
# which is (1 x 10^2) + (9 x 10^1) + (3 x 10^0) = 193
#
# Binary (aka base 2) numbers are all about 2 raised to a power eg 110:
# 2^2|2^1|2^0   ie 2 raised to a power
#  1 | 1 | 0 
#
# 110 in binary therefore = (1 x 2^2) + (1 x 2^1) + (0 x 2^0) = 6 in decimal
