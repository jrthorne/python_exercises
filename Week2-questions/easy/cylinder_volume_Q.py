# Volume of a cylinder
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following values have already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, denoting the measurements of a cylindrical
# tank:

radius = 4 # metres
height = 10 # metres

# Also assume the following library module has been imported,
# which makes constant pi available as "math.pi":

import math

# Write an expression, or expressions, to calculate the volume
# of the tank.  Print the result in a message to the screen
