# Temperature conversion
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following value has already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, denoting a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit

fahrenheit = 98.6 # degrees

# Write an expression to calculate the temperature in Celsius
# Print the result in a message to screen
#
# Hint: Given a temperature, F, in degrees Fahrenheit the equivalent
# temperature in degrees Celsius is (F - 32) * (5 / 9)

print "The temperature is", (fahrenheit - 32.0) * (5.0 / 9.0)
