# Truth test
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following value has already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, representing your trustworthiness 
# and how old you purport to be

honest = False
age = 21

# Write an expression, or expressions, to create a string
# declaring your age, and whether you are telling the truth or not
# For example the string produced might be: 'My claim that I am 21 is False'
