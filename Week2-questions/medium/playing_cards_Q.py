# Assume the following value has already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, representing a hand of playing cards - 
# where picture cards have the following values:
# Ace = 1; Jack = 11; Queen = 12; King = 13

cards = [4, 11, 4, 5, 1, 6, 8, 10, 12]

# Write an expression, or expressions, to sort the cards into
# ascending order and then insert the following cards
# while retaining the correct order:
#      4, 7, 13
# Print the new list of card values to screen

# A SOLUTION

# 1. Sort the cards
# 2. Insert the first card into its correct place
# 3. Insert the second card into its correct place
# 4. Insert the third card into its correct place
