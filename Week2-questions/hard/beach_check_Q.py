# Beach check
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following values have already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, representing the state of conditions for a
# typical full-time undergraduate

semester_break = False
assignments_done = False
assignments_due = True
weekend = True


# Write an expression, or expressions, to determine if a student
# can go to the beach, given the current state of uni commitments
# (NB: a full-time student should be dedicating 48 hrs per week
# to study including lectures, tutorials and self-directed study.
# It would seem inappropriate, for example, to be going to the
# beach during the week, during semester or on the weekend if there
# is assignment work to be done!)
