# Playing Cards - Poker
#
# THE PROBLEM
#
# Assume the following value has already been entered into the
# Python interpreter, representing a hand of playing cards - 
# where picture cards have the following values:
# Ace = 1; Jack = 11; Queen = 12; King = 13
#
# The cards are grouped into the four suits (Hearts, Diamonds,
# Clubs, Spades, in that order) using sub-lists of the hand

hand = [[5], [], [6, 8], [4, 7]]

# Write an expression, or expressions, to find the card with the
# highest face value in the hand (regardless of suit)
# and to print its value
#
# (Motivation: Sometimes in poker it is necessary to compare
# the players' largest cards in order to determine the winning hand)


# A SOLUTION
#
# Problem solving strategy:
# 1. Combine the sublists into one list

# 2. Find the highest card
